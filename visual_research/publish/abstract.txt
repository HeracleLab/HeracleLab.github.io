Research on searching for items in a search display goes back to the work of Anne Treisman in the late 1970s. One of the important ideas of searching for features with specific items (e.g., searching for a green round bottle among a large collection of bottles) is that this cannot be done in parallel; hence, the more items there are to search through, the longer it takes.

Searching for specific combinations of features in items (e.g., the ROUND GREEN bottle amongst bottles of all sorts of colors and shapes) is known as conjunctive search. The increase in conjunctive search time due to the numbers present is known as the search slope.

Example
In this experiment, you need to respond to the letter T, but only if it is in it's regular upright position and only if it is orange. You respond with the space bar (and do not do anything if no T is present). There are 50 search displays, and the task takes around 5 minutes to complete. In each display, there are 5, 10, 15, or 20 items. Search time increases with large numbers of items on the screen.
